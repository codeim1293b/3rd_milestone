# Bugs


  It proved to be quite challenging to host my website, as I had trouble signin up to Heroku with the Github Student Pack, so I ended up needing to host my app on another hosting service, called Linode. I learnt how to install an OS(Debian) to serve as my webserver, host my website with Apache, create a domain and create A records so the user can reach my app with a domain name rather than the fix IP, route all requests through Cloudflare where I was able to enable Full(strict) mode after a lot of reading about how to get a certificate signed for HTTPS connections and get my Apache server to listen to these 443 requests. I quite enjoyed learning all about these, and I hope I could submit a well designed app too.

## Automated testing

  I spent a lot of time on the internet, looking for a solution how to test this function. I found the answer after posting on Reddit.
  I had to learn how to properly bind the element, so the function can use "this".

  3. ## Code
   
  - Official site like W3School and Tailwind help to create a great layout that functions well.
  - StackOverflow helped me to see how others solved the issues their code had and I manage to use some of the solutions after customising them to fit my code.

## Deployment

  - I used GitHub for version control and to deploy my website. I also used Gitpod and its workspace to develope the website. Both of these services are connected to my Virtual Studio Code application on my PC. I have also tried "Code-server" that is hosted in a docker container on my home server, but did not had enough time to configure it properly and it was using way too much RAM so I just used VSCode on my PC.

  ### Deploying with GitHub Pages

  1. **Push your code to the `main` branch** of your GitHub repository:
      ```sh
      git add .
      git commit -m "Deploy website"
      git push origin main
      ```

  2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
       - Go to your repository on GitHub.
       - Click on `Settings`.
       - Scroll down to the `Pages` section.
       - Under `Source`, select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main`) and `/root` folder.
       - Click `Save`.

  3. **Access your website**:
       - After a few minutes, your site should be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.
